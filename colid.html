<h3>We keep the history of all published revisions of a PID Entry now. (from GitHub)</h3>
So you can review how often an entry was published, and when, and by whom, and see all the previous revisions. You can also quickly toggle between a draft and the current published information.    
Please find more information about features in the Release Notes on the <a href="https://pid-ui.prod.daaa.cloud/resource/help">Help page</a>
