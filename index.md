#### We keep the history of all published revisions of a COLID Entry now. 
So you can review how often an entry was published, and when, and by whom, and see all the previous revisions. You can also quickly toggle between a draft and the current published information.    
Please find more information about features in the Release Notes on the [Help page](XXX).
